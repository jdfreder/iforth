# Notes
- Difficult to test on Windows, because I can't find an easy way to install `gforth` on Windows - 
  installing from source is too much work ðŸ¤·!
     - Will have to try to run in WSL...

## What files are actually installed?
[How to uninstall after `python setup.py install`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1550235/12947681)

After `sudo python setup.py install --record files.txt`:
```
> cat files.txt
/usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/forth_kernel.py
/usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/__pycache__/forth_kernel.cpython-310.pyc
/usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/forth_kernel-0.2-py3.10.egg-info
```

The location of `forth_kernel` Python module is at `/home/sohang/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/forth_kernel.py`.

Additionally, the actual Jupyter Kernel is at `/usr/local/share/jupyter/kernels/forth/kernel.json`.

The command below failed due to insufficient permission, but the output is still interesting!
