# IForth

Forth kernel for the Jupyter / IPython notebook.  Requires IPython 3.x (master at the time of writing).

## Installation
1. Install [Gforth](https://www.gnu.org/software/gforth/).  Make sure it is accessible via the commandline/terminal (`gforth --version`).
2. Clone this repository and run `pip install .` (may require sudo, depending on Python location). 

## Usage
- Run `jupyter notebook` (or `ipython notebook`, whichever you prefer).
- In a new or existing notebook, use the kernel selector (located at the top right of the notebook) to select `IForth`.
